# Dog_breed_classification_using_CNN
Udacity deep learning ND CNN model project to predict dog breed

In the project i created a cnn neural network from scratch in the first part to detect the dog breed.
In the second part i made a cnn model based on a pretrained model (Resnet50) using tranfer learning to get a higher accuracy.
